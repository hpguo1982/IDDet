# IDDetï¼šInsulator Defect Detector via Residual Denoising Diffusion Mechanism

IDDet is a diffusion-based detector for quickly and accurately detecting insulators with defects.

## IDDet

*Fig. 1 framework of our proposed IDDet. The backbone extracts feature maps from the input Insulator defects image. Taking noisy bounding boxes and multiscale features as input, the detector then predicts the target category, positions (center coordinates), and sizes (widths and heights) of bounding boxes.*
